      Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically

      The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application is as
      beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve the right to
      modify the Application or charge for their services at any time and for
      any reason. The Service Provider assures you that any charges for the
      Application or its services will be clearly communicated to you.
    </div>
    <div class="terms-conditions-last-text">
      The Application stores and processes personal data that you have provided
      to the Service Provider in order to provide the Service. It is your
      responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and access to the
      Application. The Service Provider strongly advise against jailbreaking or
      rooting your phone, which involves removing software restrictions and
      limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. Such
      actions could expose your phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs,
      compromise your phone's security features, and may result in the
      Application not functioning correctly or at all. Please note that the
      Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Terms and
      Conditions. Below are the links to the Terms and Conditions of the
      third-party service providers used by the Application:

    <div class="terms-conditions-first-text">
      Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume responsibility
      for certain aspects. Some functions of the Application require an active
      internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network
      provider. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the
      Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to
      Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.
    </div>
    <div class="terms-conditions-text">
      If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware
      that your mobile network provider's agreement terms still apply.
      Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data
      usage during the connection to the application, or other third-party
      charges. By using the application, you accept responsibility for any such
      charges, including roaming data charges if you use the application outside
      of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data
      roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are
      using the application, they assume that you have obtained permission from
      the bill payer.
    </div>
    <div class="terms-conditions-text">
      Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for
      your usage of the application. For instance, it is your responsibility to
      ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of
      battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider
      cannot be held responsible.
    </div>
    <div class="terms-conditions-text">
      In terms of the Service Provider's responsibility for your use of the
      application, it is important to note that while they strive to ensure that
      it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on third parties to
      provide information to them so that they can make it available to you. The
      Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
      that you experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality
      of the application.
